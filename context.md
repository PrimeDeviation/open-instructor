Project: Open-Instructor
Goal: Create an adaptive educational dialog system.
Inspiration: The idea of a wealthy family educating their children through the daily tutoring of a polymath natural philosopher.
Current Task: Creating a CI/CD workflow in GitHub for iterative improvements.
Next Step: Check the local repo and remote GitHub actions to improve the process.

## GitHub Workflow Status
The most recent run of the GitHub workflow has failed. The failure occurred after the commit of the updated GitHub Actions. The reason for the failure is unknown.

## Detailed Failure Reason
The failure occurred during the test phase. Five tests failed with the error `OSError: pytest: reading from stdin while output is captured!  Consider using `-s`.`, and there was one warning related to the deprecation of `pkg_resources`.

## Update
The last two runs of the GitHub Actions workflow on the self-improvement branch have failed. The failures are associated with the commits Update versions of GitHub Actions and Update Python version to 3.10 in GitHub Actions workflow. The error OSError: pytest: reading from stdin while output is captured!  Consider using `-s`. occurred in five tests: test_hello_world, test_math, test_delayed_exec, test_nested_loops_and_multiple_newlines, test_markdown. Next step is to investigate the tests that failed to understand why they are trying to read from stdin.

## Update
We discovered that the workflow by the original developers already existed in a workflow file called python-package.yml. We updated this workflow to run on commits to our current branch, self-improvement.
